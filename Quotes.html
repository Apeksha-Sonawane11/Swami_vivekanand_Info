    <p class="box"> "The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in
        reverence before every human being and see God in himâ€”that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds
        vanishes, and I am free."</p>
    <p class="box"> "The more we come out and do good to others, the more our hearts will be purified, and God will be
        in them."</p>
    <p class="box"> "Feel nothing, know nothing, do nothing, have nothing, give up all to God, and say utterly, 'Thy
        will be done.' We only dream this bondage. Wake up and let it go."</p>
