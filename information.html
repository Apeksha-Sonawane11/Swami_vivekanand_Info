    <h2> Story : </h2>
    <p class="info"  id="i3"> There is a well-known incident in the life of Swami Vivekananda involving monkeys during his visit to the
        Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) Ashram in Kerala, India. The story goes like this:

        During his travels, Swami Vivekananda spent some time in Thiruvananthapuram, where there was an ashram
        surrounded by a dense forest. One day, while he was meditating in the woods, a group of mischievous monkeys
        gathered around him.

        Initially, the monkeys were curious and playful, but they soon became more disruptive, climbing on him and
        causing a disturbance during his meditation. Despite their antics, Swami Vivekananda remained calm and focused
        on his spiritual practices.

        As the monkeys continued to disturb him, the other people in the ashram became concerned and tried to shoo the
        monkeys away. However, Swami Vivekananda stopped them, saying, "Leave them alone. Let them be. They have every
        right to be here."

        His response reflected his deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings and his respect for
        nature. Swami Vivekananda believed in the oneness of all life and saw divinity in every creature. Rather than
        reacting with frustration or annoyance, he used the situation to demonstrate his teachings about compassion and
        tolerance.

        This incident is often shared to highlight Swami Vivekananda's ability to remain composed and compassionate in
        challenging situations, even when faced with playful and disruptive monkeys. It serves as a reminder of his
        teachings on universal love, understanding, and the interconnectedness of all living beings.</p>


    <p class="info"  id="i4"> Swami Vivekananda's relationship with his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, played a significant role in shaping his
        early life and his later spiritual journey. Here's a glimpse into their story:

        Early Influence:
        Bhuvaneshwari Devi, a devout woman, had a profound impact on young Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda's birth
        name). She instilled in him a sense of spirituality and compassion from an early age. She was supportive of her
        son's intellectual pursuits and encouraged him to explore different philosophies and religions.

        Encouragement for Spiritual Quest:
        As Narendranath grew older, his interest in spiritual matters intensified. Bhuvaneshwari Devi supported his
        quest for truth and encouraged his association with Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, a saint whom Narendranath
        initially had reservations about. She recognized the depth of Ramakrishna's spirituality and saw him as a
        guiding light for her son.

        Acceptance of Monastic Life:
        When Narendranath expressed his desire to renounce the world and become a monk, his mother was initially
        hesitant. However, after understanding the depth of his spiritual yearning, Bhuvaneshwari Devi gave her
        wholehearted consent, demonstrating her deep love and respect for her son's chosen path.

        Support During Challenging Times:
        Swami Vivekananda faced numerous challenges and hardships during his early days as a wandering monk. His mother,
        even in her modest circumstances, supported him emotionally and spiritually. She continued to encourage him to
        persevere in his mission.

        Visiting the United States:
        When Swami Vivekananda received the opportunity to represent Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions
        in Chicago in 1893, his mother supported him despite financial constraints. She sold her jewelry to fund his
        journey, emphasizing the importance of his mission for the greater good.

        Passing Away:
        Unfortunately, Bhuvaneshwari Devi did not live to see the full extent of her son's accomplishments. She passed
        away in 1901, just a year before Swami Vivekananda's own untimely death.

        The relationship between Swami Vivekananda and his mother reflects a profound connection built on mutual
        respect, love, and understanding. Bhuvaneshwari Devi's unwavering support for her son's spiritual journey
        showcases the importance of familial encouragement in one's pursuit of a higher purpose. The sacrifices she made
        and the values she instilled in him played a crucial role in shaping Swami Vivekananda's character and mission.

    <p class="info "  id="i5"> There is a popular story associated with Swami Vivekananda and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, involving a
        request for a knife. This incident is often cited as a powerful demonstration of a mother's selfless love and a
        son's deep commitment to his chosen path.

        As Swami Vivekananda embarked on his spiritual journey and decided to renounce the world to become a monk, he
        faced the challenge of convincing his mother about his decision. Bhuvaneshwari Devi, like any concerned mother,
        was naturally distressed at the thought of her son renouncing worldly life.

        One day, as Swami Vivekananda was discussing his decision with his mother, she became emotional and asked him if
        he could make a promise to her. She requested him to promise that he would come back home if the life of a monk
        became too difficult or if he faced hardships.

        In response to his mother's request, Swami Vivekananda, with great love and respect, said, "I cannot make that
        promise. My first duty is to God, and it is to Him that I must render an account of my actions. I am sure that
        my path is right, and I must follow it even though difficulties may arise."

        Seeing her son's determination and understanding his deep commitment to his spiritual mission, Bhuvaneshwari
        Devi asked for one final assurance. She requested him to at least provide her with a knife so that she could end
        her life if the burden of separation became too overwhelming.

        In response to this poignant request, Swami Vivekananda reassured his mother, saying, "Mother, you have waited
        these long years to see me grown to manhood. If now, in the prime of life, I leave you, my duty to you is over.
        Where can I find a nobler mother, more worthy of love and reverence? Should I not do this little for her?"

        This story reflects the deep emotional struggle faced by both Swami Vivekananda and his mother during this
        pivotal moment in their lives. It also illustrates the intense sacrifice and commitment that Swami Vivekananda
        had for his spiritual calling, as well as the profound love and understanding that existed between him and his
        mother.</p>
